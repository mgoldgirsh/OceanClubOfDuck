                <p>
                    Can you guess what type of duck our house mascot is? Meet Dapper, a Drake
                    Pintail, chosen for his regal appearance and striking coloring. From the very
                    beginning, Dapper inspired the design of our beach house, and we had a lot
                    of fun weaving his personality throughout the space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You’ll spot Dapper in all kinds of places—as you pull up the driveway, he
                    greets you from the house sign. Look for him again on the welcome mats and
                    entry tile, as well as on the robes and glassware. And because he’s a duck
                    who loves the water—and water sports—you can even find Dapper riding a
                    surfboard and relaxing on the bottom of the pool! Being a duck with style,
                    Dapper likes to switch up his look now and then. Some days he’s sporting a
                    classic black bow tie; other days, a cheerful blue one. Keep an eye out—his
                    outfit might just change during your stay.
